# How to improve organization productivity through note taking with obsidian.

## Motivation
The idea of develop this document come from an ideation time meeting where during the presentation of tasks advances we noticed that the advances done in the week where in the wrong direction despite having been commented on in previous meetings the direction to follow. For example, a framework ([[AWS Lex]]) were recommended to develop a chatbot and the task did where develop a chatbot from scratch with [[misc/Open AI]] [[GPT3]].

So the idea of this document is to analyze the current state of the art in note taking and productivity improvement with obsidian and propose best practices to create a collaborative workspace.

## Ideas

1. We could use the [[Obsidian Dataview]] frontmatter notation to organize the different document types. The document types we gonna need are:
	1. Meeting notes
	2. Main project notes
	3. Project apps, tools and experiment notes

2. In the meetings when a presentation is occurring some members of the team make recommendations based on its own experience, so we need a method to persist this recommendations in a meeting note.


## Using Dataview

[[Obsidian Dataview]] is a plugin to query some type of documents as a table, list etc. Inside its own note 

### Note types
#### Meeting notes
Notes taken in the meetings, it should contain a summary, a each member presentation with it tasks advances, and maybe a overview of each project in current development.

#### Main project notes
Each project has to have a main project note with a summary of all the resources generated in the development phase for that project. For example, links to all the app notes, architecture notes, tasks notes.

#### Project apps, tools and experiment notes
This note have to be like a readme, it should contain instructions to deploy the project or set a development environment to continue its development. Each app, tool or experiment should contain an unique short-name that will work as an identification to detect witch tasks are related with it.
