## Description

This project aims to provide a guide or a collection of tips to improve the note taking routines in a daily job. It is based on the experience that I have acquired after several years of intensive note taking in my work that allowed me to create my own system and improve it gradually.

This file will guide you through a series of documents that will explain how I use the program, which plugins I use and how I use them in addition it will set a collection of rules that you can follow. 
I will try to do it in a interactive fashion to allow you to have fun while you learn.

Thank you very much and lets getting started.
