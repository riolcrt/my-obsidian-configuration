## Create a task in todoist each time a note with the text "Tarea" is added to onedrive

I have my obsidian fully backed on onedrive, so it is perpetually synced in all my computers. It also allows me to run scripts based on the file creation.

This script is done in [[Microsoft Power Automate]] within my personal account.
