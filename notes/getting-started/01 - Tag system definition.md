#tutorial 

Hello there, glad to see you here. Lets get's started. This is the Tag system definition document. In obsidian you can create all kind of tags using the # character followed by any text, for example this file has the tag #tutorial related with it. 

The tags can also be added to a document using the frontmatter syntax. This will be explained later in this same tutorial so don't worry if the words are strange to you right now.

This document pretends to create a series of rules that are used to limit how we gonna create the tags that will be present in all documents in obsidian that will be part of the organization. The tags are a very powerful tool, but a great power requires great responsibility so let me limit the power of this tool for you through rules.

## Motivation

Create the ability of sort and search through the notes in an intuitive way. It could also be used to train [[nlp]] models to tag automatically new created notes.

## Rules

1. The tags should describe what **KIND** of document you are creating.
2. The sub-tags should be a **TYPE OF** thing **not PART OF** a thing
3. The tags should respect a hierarchy, where the main tag should be the highest level possible

## Examples

### High order tags
#### Person
#### Company
#### Tech
#### Project
#### Resource
#### Note
1. **Daily notes**
2. **Meeting notes**

#### Development
1. **Frontend**
2. **Backend**
3. **Data-science
